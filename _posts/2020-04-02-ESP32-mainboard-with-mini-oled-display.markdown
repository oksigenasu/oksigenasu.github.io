i always fascinated by how Espressif can cram all the stuffs inside an SoC.  And ESP32 is a hell of a fine chip to play with.  it got WiFi and bluetooth and many other feature ready to explore.

that being said, having stuck in this whole Corona situation i decided to order some ESP32 development board to tinker with.  my choice goes to [LoLin32 Lite](https://diyprojects.io/wemos-lolin32-lite-compact-revision-lolin32-4-90/) (Retired unfortunately) from wemos.  It has a compact form factor, plenty GPIO's and more importantly, a battery connector for optional portability.  with it i order a 0.91" OLED display to help with development.

with this setup, i would like to explore some function:
* OLED Display via I2C pin
* BLE function as a dummy sensor
* WiFi message display
* Dummy IoT sensor
* NTP Clock
* Praying Time Clock

just need to wait a couple days for the lolin to arrive.
will post later!
