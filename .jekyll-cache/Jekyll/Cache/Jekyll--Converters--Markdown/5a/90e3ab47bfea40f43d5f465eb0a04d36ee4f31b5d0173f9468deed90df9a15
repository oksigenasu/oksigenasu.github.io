I"¯<p>i always fascinated by how Espressif can cram all the stuffs inside an SoC.  And ESP32 is a hell of a fine chip to play with.  it got WiFi and bluetooth and many other feature ready to explore.</p>

<p>that being said, having stuck in this whole Corona situation i decided to order some ESP32 development board to tinker with.  my choice goes to <a href="https://diyprojects.io/wemos-lolin32-lite-compact-revision-lolin32-4-90/">LoLin32 Lite</a> (Retired unfortunately) from wemos.  It has a compact form factor, plenty GPIO‚Äôs and more importantly, a battery connector for optional portability.  with it i order a 0.91‚Äù OLED display to help with development.</p>

<p>with this setup, i would like to explore some function:</p>
<ul>
  <li>OLED Display via I2C pin</li>
  <li>BLE function as a dummy sensor</li>
  <li>WiFi message display</li>
  <li>Dummy IoT sensor</li>
  <li>NTP Clock</li>
  <li>Praying Time Clock</li>
</ul>

<p>just need to wait a couple days for the lolin to arrive.
will post later!</p>
